## OVERVIEW

The digital world is full of information, most of which is communicated in language (webpages, social media posts, news articles, long-format stories, etc). How can we use computers to understand and use this information to perform meaningful tasks? This course will provide you with the opportunity to learn the latest, advanced **machine learning** approaches to language processing. Further, a core component of the course will concern research, as you’ll produce an **original research project** while working in groups of 3-4 students.

## ENROLLMENT
The demand for this course content is extremely high, and we're thrilled to see so many curious students! Over 400 students have registered for the course, so we are resource-constrained. To provide as smooth of an educational experience as possible, we strongly recommend that every enrolled student has a strong foundation in Machine Learning, and we will enforce having the sufficient pre-req courses.

### PREREQUISITES
No prior NLP experience is expected or necessary, but students must have a basic foundation in probability and calculus, along with strong knowledge of Machine Learning. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">See the [syllabus](syllabus) for more details, along with HW #0 (ungraded)</span> to assess if your current knowledge is aligned with the pre-req expectations -- you should be able to answer all of the questions without too much difficulty.

### WHAT'S NEW?
NLP is an incredibly fast-moving field! Fun fact, ChatGPT was released the day before our final lecture of the semester in Fall 2022. Since then, NLP and GenerativeAI has become a household name. To showcase recent progress within NLP, we are introducing approximately three new lectures that span topics including: decoding (search and sampling), mixture-of-experts (MoE), quantization of transformers, state-space models such as Mamba. We'll also have a new guest lecture with insights about training LLMs in industry! Consequently, to make room for such, we are removing some of our content about structured predictions. e.g., Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).

NOTE: Despite the immense capabilities of large language models (LLMs), this course will be strongly rooted in providing a foundation for NLP; that is, we will cover a wide range of modelling approaches that include LLMs and more.
